## 1. Purpose of This README

This README documents the Assessment 3 project and should be completed by the student.

It is used to:

- summarise the project;
- explain the structure and technical choices;
- document database, security, authentication, testing, and deployment decisions;
- support marking of documentation and submission quality;
- help AI tools such as GitHub Copilot follow the assessment requirements.

TODO: After completing the project, update every TODO section in this file.

---

## 2. Copilot and AI Coding Instructions

This section must be completed by the student after reading the Assessment 3 brief.

Write clear instructions that would help GitHub Copilot or another AI tool produce code that follows the Assessment 3 requirements.

Your instructions should help the AI understand what it is allowed to generate, what it must not generate, and which assessment constraints must be followed.

TODO: Include instructions about:

- allowed technologies;
- technologies, frameworks, libraries, or tools that must not be used;
- required files and folders;
- PHP include file requirements;
- database connection requirements;
- MySQLi procedural prepared statement requirements;
- session and flash-message requirements;
- registration, login, and logout requirements;
- authentication and authorisation requirements;
- owner-only edit and delete requirements;
- CRUD requirements;
- search requirements;
- seller page requirements;
- image upload and validation requirements;
- CSS and JavaScript file requirements;
- Bootstrap layout requirements;
- gallery modal requirements;
- book status filtering requirements;
- deletion confirmation requirements;
- security requirements;
- deployment requirements;
- AI usage and process-evidence requirements.

### My Copilot / AI instructions

TODO: Write your Copilot/AI instructions here in clear bullet points.

- Use PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5, and MySQL only.
- Do not use React, Angular, Vue, Node.js, Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter, PDO, or other frameworks.
- Follow the required project file and folder structure.
- Every PHP page must include: includes/header.inc, includes/nav.inc, includes/footer.inc which use resuasable include files to avoid duplicate code.
- Create a single connection file: includes/db_connect.inc which automatically detect localhost or Coreteaching/Jacob 5 environment.
- All queries must use prepared statements.
- Start sessions where necessary. Flash messages must use $_SESSION and display success or error feedback after registration, login, logout, add record, edit record and delete record.
Messages should be shown once and then removed from the session.
- Registration: create new user account and use password_hash(), automatically log the user in after succesful registration, store user information in session.
- Login: Authenticate using username/email and passowrd, verify password using password_verify().
- Logout: Destroy session, redirect to home page. 
- Authentication: Only logged-in users can access add.php
- Authorisation: Only the owner of a book can edit and delete the record. Owndership must be checked server-side before editing or deleting a record.
- Before editing or deleting, retrieve the record owner, compare ownder ID against the logged-in user's ID and deny access if IDs do not match.
- Only show Edit and Delete buttons to the owner. Deletion must remove database row and remove uploaded image file.
- Create: add.php, insert new book record, upload image, generate unique filename.
- Read: index.php, books.php, gallery.php, details.php, seller.php, search.php
- Update: edit.php, replace image if a new image is uploaded, delete old image file, retain existing image if no new file uploaded.
- Delete: owner only, confimation required, remove record and image.
- search.php allows users to search title, author, description using a keyword search with prepared statements.
- seller.php displays all books belonging to the selected owner, suing an owner ID passed through the query string (prepared statements). No login required to view the page. The owner links must appear on index.php, books.php, details.php. If the seller is logged in, they also have a link to their page in the navbar.
- Validate image uploads by checking file type, extension, size, and upload errors. 
- Store uploaded images in the specified upload folder and save filenames in the database.
- Do not use original filenames. Generate unique names using uniqid() or suffxing the original filename with a timestamp e.g. time() or date() functions
- Keep CSS and JavaScript in separate external files where required. Do not generate inline JavaScript.
- Use Bootstrap's grid system and components for responsive layouts throughout the site.
- gallery.php displays all book images which come from database recrods. Clicking an image opens a Boostrap modal which displays full-size image. 
- books.php retrive all records from database and generate filter options dynamically from status values. Filtering must be client-side only and use JavaScript show/hide logic.
- When users click Delete, open Boostrap confirmation modal, require user confirmation beofore deletion and modal functionality must be handled through scripts.js
- Protect against SQL injection, XSS, and invalid file uploads. Escape all output using htmlspecialchars().
- Ensure the application runs correctly on the Titan server using relative paths where appropriate.
- Use AI to explain concepts, review code, identify bugs and suggest improvements. 
- process-evidence.md file must include at least 5 debugging records, at least 5 records of meaningful AI use and links to relevant GitHub commits.
